Directory for files of spherical design quadrature points on S^2.

To set up:

wget https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~rsw/Sphere/Points/SF/SF29-Nov-2012.zip
unzip SF29-Nov-2012.zip
mv SF29-Nov-2012/* .
rm -f *.zip
rmdir SF29-Nov-2012

This downloads about 28 MB then creates 73 MB of files in this directory.

These are from Rob Womersley
School of Mathematics and Statistics
UNSW Sydney.

They have equal weights 4pi/N.
They are exact for the degree t given in filename sf{t}.{N}
N ~ t^2/2
which is only 2/3 as efficient as Lebedev points, in terms of exact
quadrature of spherical harmonics.
However, they are more uniform.
